# Control of a Car Wash Gantry

The aim is to design a simplified system to drive a car wash gantry. 
Thus, and in order to simplify the exercise, we consider only the horizontal roller of the gantry. 
This project is part of the E1 module "Embedded Systems Design" during the 3rd year of the engineering cycle at Polytech Nantes.

## Organization of the project

The project takes place in 6 sessions of practical work of 3 hours each.
The Git repository contains all the productions that will have emanated from these sessions, both the design and the development.
The report will be modified on a weekly basis.
